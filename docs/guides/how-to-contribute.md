# Contribute to the documentation

The docs are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) if you need help with the syntax use [this guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). <br />
Mkdocs uses some [Markdown extensions](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#markdown-extensions) that you may have to familiarize with.

The documentation source is maintained via [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)<br />
For novice users that don't know how to use the command line you can use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).<br />
