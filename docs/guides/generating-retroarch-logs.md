# Generating RetroArch Logs

### What are Logs? Why are they so important?

RetroArch and its underlying libretro technology is designed to run across an unusually wide range of hardware, operating system, libretro core, and content combinations. It is not possible for a volunteer-based open source project to test all possible combinations. Therefore libretro and RetroArch software is designed to generate "logs", which record essential information about your issue that other users and volunteers need to help troubleshoot problems and improve compatibility with new systems.

## Creating Log files in Linux

### RetroArch log in Linux
Start the retroarch service in 'verbose' mode with this command: `retroarch --menu --verbose >> RA-log.txt 2>&1`. The file RA-log.txt is now stored in the home directory.

### Graphic card logs

`lspci -nnk | grep -A 3 VGA` will give information about your graphic card.

### Audio device logs

`aplay -L` enumerates audio devices which have been detected by Lakka.

### Input device logs

`lsusb` lists all devices attached via USB

`dmesg` displays all messages from the kernel ring buffer which typically is holding the messages generated by Lakka's Linux kernel from the boot process. The dmesg log lists each hardware device that the kernel detected along with information on how the device was configured by the system.

## Creating Log files in Windows

1. Open a console window with the `cmd` command. 
2. Navigate to the RetroArch folder
3. Launch RetroArch with this commandline: `retroarch_debug --menu --verbose > RA-log.txt`

## Creating Log files in Android
Gathering log files in Android requires a third-party app that can interface with the `logcat` system. Many free apps are available via Android's "Play Store" system.
