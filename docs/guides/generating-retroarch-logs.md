# Generating RetroArch Logs

### What are Logs? Why are they so important?

RetroArch and its underlying libretro technology is designed to run across an unusually wide range of hardware, operating system, libretro core, and content combinations. It is not possible for a volunteer-based open source project to test all possible combinations.

The answer to this dilemma involves the "logs", which RetroArch and other libretro software use to record essential information about your issue that other users and volunteers need in order to help troubleshoot problems and improve compatibility with new systems.

## Creating Log files in Linux

### RetroArch log in Linux
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the RetroArch folder with the `cd` command.
3. Start retroarch in 'verbose' mode with this command: `retroarch --menu --verbose >> RA-log.txt 2>&1`
4. Once you exit RetroArch, a file called RA-log.txt is now stored in your home directory.

### Graphic card logs
`lspci -nnk | grep -A 3 VGA` will give information about your graphic card.

### Audio device logs
`aplay -L` enumerates audio devices which have been detected.

### Input device logs
`lsusb` lists all devices attached via USB

`dmesg` displays all messages from the kernel ring buffer which typically is holding the messages generated by Lakka's Linux kernel from the boot process. The dmesg log lists each hardware device that the kernel detected along with information on how the device was configured by the system.

## Creating Log files in Windows
1. Open a console window with the `cmd` command, found either in the Start Menu or through use of the Windows "Run" menu. 
2. Navigate to the RetroArch folder using the `cd` command.
3. Launch RetroArch with this commandline: `retroarch_debug --menu --verbose > RA-log.txt`
4. Once you exit RetroARch, a file called RA-log.txt is now stored in the RetroArch folder.

## Creating Log files in OS X
1. Open a console window with the OS X "Terminal" app.
2. Navigate to the RetroArch folder using the `cd` command.
3. Launch RetroArch with this commandline: `retroarch --menu --verbose --log-file ~/RA-log.txt`
4. Once you exit RetroArch, a file called RA-log.txt is now stored in your home directory.

## Creating Log files in Android
Gathering log files in Android requires a third-party app that can interface with the `logcat` system. Many free apps are available via Android's "Play Store" system.
