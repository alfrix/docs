## Background

Nes_Emu, the core NES emulator library used by QuickNES, began as a very simple NES emulator sometime in 2004. It was based on the 6502 CPU core and APU sound core used in the Game_Music_Emu sound engine.

### Why use this core?

Awaiting description.

### How to get and install the QuickNES core:

1. Start up RetroArch. Inside the main menu, go to 'Online Updater'.

2. Just to make sure we have the latest info files, select 'Update Core Info FIles'. Wait until this is done. Then, select 'Core Updater'.

3. Browse through the list and select 'NES / Famicom (QuickNES)'.

After this has finished downloading, the core should now be ready for use!

#### How to start (after installation):

2. Browse to the folder that contains the content you want to run.
