# ScummVM

## Background

ScummVM is an interpreter program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed

## Scanning Support

To allow launching ScummVM games from the menu, you'll need to do the following:

1. Look up the Game ID of the game you're looking to add to the menu. Game IDs can be found in [ScummVM's compatibility list](http://scummvm.org/compatibility).
    > `monkey` for Monkey Island

2. Inside the game directory, create a `.scummvm` file, named by the Game ID
    > `monkey.scummvm` for Monkey Island

3. Open up the file in a text editor, and enter in the Game ID.
    > `echo monkey > monkey.scummvm`

4. (Optional) Alternatively, you could download a prepared `.scummvm` file from [libretro-database-scummvm](https://github.com/RobLoach/libretro-database-scummvm/tree/master/games).

5. Scan each game directory

This is an example of what the playlist would look like:

```
    /storage/roms/scummvm/monkey/monkey.scummvm
    The Secret of Monkey Island
    /tmp/cores/scummvm_libretro.so
    ScummVM
    b0e2af30|crc
    ScummVM.lpl
```
