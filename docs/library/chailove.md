# ChaiLove

## Background

[ChaiLove](https://github.com/RobLoach/ChaiLove) is a framework for making 2D games with [ChaiScript](http://chaiscript.com/). ChaiLove games can be played with LibRetro/RetroArch through the ChaiLove core.

#### How to start the ChaiLove core:

- As an example showcasing loading content with Chailove core, we will load the Floppy Bird game hosted on RetroArch's Content Downloader.

You can do this by going to RetroArch's main menu screen and selecting 'Online Updater'. From there, select 'Content Downloader'.

- Select 'ChaiLove', then select 'Floppy Bird.chailove'. This should download and extract this file to RetroArch's Downloads directory.
