# Sega Dreamcast Core Compatibility

## Reicast

General Reicast Issues

- The date and time do not seem to get properly saved, as the system will ask you to set the clock every time you start. 
- Once you save to a VMU slot with any game, that VMU becomes inaccessible the next time you load the emulator. 
- Polygon sorting issues can make objects appear distorted. 
- When using an Xbox 360 Controller, analog triggers don't work properly. Use the bumpers instead. 
- Changing games without closing and reloading RetroArch often leads to RetroArch crashing.
